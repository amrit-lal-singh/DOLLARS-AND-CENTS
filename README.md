# DOLLARS-AND-CENTS
You are provided with a sequence of integers of length n. You can make guesses on what that number can be. Once you make a guess in return you will receive 2 outputs i.e. number of ’Cents’ and ’Dollars’.‘Cents’ denote the number of digits guessed which are present in the given sequence but are out of position, whereas ‘Dollars’ represent the number of digits guessed which are present in the sequence at the very position you guessed them at. As you might have guessed it, the game ends when you get exactly n Dollars. Your solution must be optimised enough to run for strings of length 10.
